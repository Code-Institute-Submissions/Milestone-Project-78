# My Second Project: Sadie’s Farm
This project is about creating a card matching game using cartoon pictures of zoo animals. The aim of the game is to entertain users who are looking for an activity to participate in for the sake of passing time by. The game is played by the user clicking or tapping on the cards in order to flip them. All the cards have the same image of a question mark on them. Once one card is flipped, a zoo animal will show. The user is to find the other card that has the same zoo animal displayed. If successful, the cards will disappear. If not, the cards will flip back. The game is won once the user has successfully found all the zoo animal paired cards.


# UX
- This game is for any user who wants to play a game for fun or to help time pass by.
- This game will provide the users information on how long they spent trying to find the matching animal cards, on completion.
- Users who play this game will want to find the matching cards in the shortest amount of time possible and will repeat the game to do so.


# User Stories 
- As a user of the Sadie’s Farm card matching game, I want to be able to understand how to play the game quickly. 
- As a user of the Sadie’s Farm card matching game, I want to see how long I took to match all the cards. 
- As a user of the Sadie’s Farm card matching game, I want the card’s order to change after every attempt to keep the game challenging. 


# Designer Goals
- As the designer of the Sadie’s Farm card matching game, I want to make a simple layout that will help the user easily guide themself through the game.
- As the designer of the Sadie’s Farm card matching game, I want to create a popup that displays how long the user took in completing the game, after each try.
- As the designer of the Sadie’s Farm card matching game, I want to implement a functionality that makes the cards shuffle after each game play, so the user remains interested in the game.

# Deployment 
On completion in creating this project, the following procedures were taken in order to deploy the website:
1) First, the repository section on GitHub was entered and the project link containing the website and wireframes to be deployed, was clicked on.
2) Then, the settings tab underneath the “Milestone-Project-2” heading, was clicked on to enter its settings.
3) Next, the settings page was then scrolled down until the sub-title “GitHub Pages” was found.
4) Later, under “GitHub Pages” a sub-title called “Source” was located. Under the “Source” sub-title was a button labelled “None”. This “None” button was clicked on to reveal a dropdown menu.
5) In the dropdown menu the option called “master branch” was selected.
6) After selecting the “master branch”, the webpage refreshed automatically and deployed the website.
7) Finally, the link to this newly deployed website, was taken from the “GitHub Pages” section.
